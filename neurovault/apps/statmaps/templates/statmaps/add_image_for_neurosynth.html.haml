                        Welcome to NeuroVault - a web repository for statistical 
                        maps of the human brain. After filling in the minimum
                        information outlined below (only the fields with an 
                        asteriks [*] are compulsory), your map 
                        will be sent back to <a href="http://neurosynth.org">Neurosynth.org</a> for
                        decoding. <b>Remeber that your map needs to be unthresholded and in MNI152
                        space for decoding to work correctly!</b>.
                        
			            You can always come back to 
			            <a href="http://neurovault.org">NeuroVault.org</a> to 
			            inspect, modify, and/or delete your maps. Unless you choose
			            otherwise your maps are private. That means 
			            only you and whoever you share the link with can see them.
